# Setting a password for the discovery ISO
The discovery ISO generated by the Assisted Installer comes with with a `core` user that has its password login disabled (although SSH access using the provided public key is still supported).

However, it can still sometimes be useful to login with a password (e.g when SSH isn't working). To do that, it's possible to use the Assisted Installer API which provides support for editing the discovery ISO's ignition file with custom parameters.

The following script provides an example of how to use the API in order to modify the discovery ISO in order to set `core`'s password to any password of your choice.

For more information about the API and its various authentication methods, see [this document](cloud.md).

# Modify password script
